##Blow the doors off GearHead-based stereotypes


[Coming soon to Heroku](http://timelaps.herokuapp.com)


###Listen. Admitting to being a *GearHead* shouldn't be an indictment of your social conscience.


**Timelaps** exists to express your love of automotive-based awesomeness.  Anyone 'in the know' in the automotive world recognizes that auto racing is as much about a car's engineering and design as it is about the driver's skill, technique, and style.  

##What is it?
**Timelaps** is an open sourced web application designed to allow *anyone* who is a fan of auto racing to watch the sport from a whole new perspective.  View racing live streams, hear driver radio chat, watch the car respond to driver inputs, and get ideas for modifications and tuning.  

Following a driver or favoriting a car will give racing enthusiasts a chance to understand racing, and race driving, in a whole new way.  Instead of watching a once-a-week or once-a-month race on race day, fans can now subscribe to feeds and watch their favorite drivers change their driving style *over time*, learning tricks, improving, and adjusting to environments.

Fans (and Tuners) will also be able to follow their favorite *RIDES*, watching as owners build out and modify their cars for track, for show, or just to show-off around the neighborhood.

###Finally! Drivers, Tuners, Engineers, and Fans alike will have a platform to share:
* Video feeds and live streams of actual amateur racers
* ODB/2 Auto Data in a **highly visualized, beautiful way**, in-sync with video, maps, and radio chatter
* Car modifications, retailers, and best pricing
* Experience with modifications
* Driving tips
* Skills and Tricks
* Driving styles
